# Commonplan 

Commonplan is an open-source web app for mapping comments.
It is built on the [Heroku MEAN 
stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api) and uses 
the 
[Angular-leaflet-directive](http://tombatossals.github.io/angular-leaflet-directive/#!/) 
to interact with the [Leaflet API](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html).

You can deploy a live copy of this application to Heroku with the button below.
